# Database-Quiz
A simple quiz for testing your knowledge of database theory
Which includes but is not limited to more than 300+ questions, with true or false questions and questions with 4 options.
The questions are also not random but based on your result for every question, so those that you get wrong are more prone to appear in a short time. (This is for Main.py)

# Usage
1. Download the zip file and extract it 
2. Install `Python`
3. Use CMD to run the `Main.py` to run the test so that questions repeat, based on your results.
3.1 Use CMD to run the `Main2.py` to run the test so that the questions don't repeat, just go randomly and don't repeat until you have finished all 240 questions.
4. If you don't know to use CMD (command prompt)use some IDE (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc)
