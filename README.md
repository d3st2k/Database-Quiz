# Database-Quiz
A simple quiz for testing your knowledge of database theory
Which includes but is not limited to more than 300+ questions, with true or false questions and questions with 4 options.
The questions are also not random but based on your result for every question, so those that you get wrong are more prone to appear in a short time. (This is for Main.py)

# Usage
1. Download the zip file and extract it 
2. Install `Python`
3. Use CMD to run the `Main.py` to run the test so that questions repeat, based on your results.
4. Use CMD to run the `Main2.py` to run the test so that the questions don't repeat. The questions just go random and aren't repeated, no matter your results.
5 If you don't know to use CMD (command prompt)use some IDE (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc)

## Extra stuff (skip if you want)!
1. To translate the questions into another language, do this.
2. Install the required library: `pip install translate`
3. Change this parameter ``to_lang="sq"``, in the `Main.py` file or `Main2.py` file where "en" represents English. For language abbreviations lookup on this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes and just change the "en" with something else.
